# ini-ethz-notes

These are my summary notes for the course Introduction to Neuroinformatics. They are based in some part [this summary](https://github.com/benelot/eth-intro-to-neuroinformatics-summary) in addition to my own notes which come from the slides and lecture recordings. 

## Disclaimer 

I am just a student, these notes can and most likely do have some mistakes. If you spot any please feel free to open an issue and I will correct them. Additionally I am not part of the course staff so I cannot guarantee that these notes cover all the required exam content. Remember to use the slides and textbooks in your prep aswell.
