# ini-ethz-notes

These are my summary notes for the course Introduction to Neuroinformatics. They are based in some part [this summary](https://github.com/benelot/eth-intro-to-neuroinformatics-summary) in addition to my own notes which come from the slides and lecture recordings. 

These notes were made with [typst](https://typst.app/) you can view them in the online editor [here](https://typst.app/project/rqeB7YNevES8X43H2QJZ30) which also has a button to download them as a pdf. Alternatively you can use the `.pdf` in the repository, though I cannot guarantee that its up to date with the online version. I will try and post the new pdf if I change the notes at a later date.

## Disclaimer 

I am just a student, these notes can and most likely do have some mistakes. If you spot any please feel free to open an issue and I will correct them. Additionally I am not part of the course staff so I cannot guarantee that these notes cover all the required exam content. Remember to use the slides and textbooks in your prep aswell.
